skype4pidgin2irc -
  a nifty little script that allows you
  to bridge an IRC channel and a skype group chat
  inspired by the 'chat.php' script at
  https://github.com/robertbasic/blog-examples/tree/master/dbus


skype4pidgin2irc install instructions for debian (ymmv)


/* install pidgin and the skype plugin */

ensure you have access to the multiverse repositories then

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install pidgin pidgin-skype


/* install the php bridge */

install build dependencies if necessary which may include

    sudo apt-get install php-pear pkg-config php5-dev libdbus-1-dev libxml2-dev

then install the dbus php bindings

    pecl install dbus-beta

Add the extension=dbus.so line to your 'php.ini' config for command line

    echo extension=dbus.so >> /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

Look at the phpinfo(); and be sure there is an entry for D-Bus


/* configure pidgin */

launch pidgin and create and activate an 'IRC' account
and set 'Username' and 'Server' under 'Login Options'
launch pidgin and create and activate a 'skype(D-Bus)' account
and set 'Username' under 'Login Options'
(you can also check 'Auto-start Skype' on the 'Advanced' tab)

you can test that your pidgin accounts are setup properly by running
the 'list-pidgin-accounts.php' via the terminal

    list-pidgin-accounts.php

once skype is running it will ask you to give pidgin API permission


/* configure skype4pidgin2irc */

open the file 'skype4pidgin2irc.php' in a text editor

    nano skype4pidgin2irc.php5

add to the $ADMIN_NICKS array any nicks that require admin access
by default $ADMIN_NICKS may chat only on individual channels as usual
and their messages will not propogate to other channels unless properly prefixed
save and launch 'skype4pidgin2irc.php' via the terminal

    php skype4pidgin2irc.php

in pidgin open a chat session with each channel you want to bridge
you may need to get someone else to chat into the skype group
before it will appear in pidgin - then post the following chat message
into each of the channels youd like to bridge

    ?/addch1

this script handles two bridges with multiple channels each
there is currently no limit to the number of channels that may be bridged (uayor)
to create a second discrete bridge repeat as above with the chat message

    ?/addch2


/* nifty tips for additional awesomeness */

for added coolness i suggest changing you IRC nick to 'SKYPE'

    /nick SKYPE

and in skype set 'Real Name' in your profile to 'IRC'


/* admin commands */

the following admin commands are currently supported:

    ?/add1
        - adds this channel to bridge 1
    ?/add2
        - adds this channel to bridge 2
    ?/rem1
        - removes this channel from bridge 1
    ?/rem2
        - removes this channel from bridge 2
    ?/disable1
        - disable bridge 1
    ?/disable2
        - disable bridge 2
    ?/enable1
        - enable bridge 1
    ?/enable2
        - enable bridge 2
    ?/status
        - shows status information for bridges 1 & 2
    ?/echo 'SOME_TEXT'
        - echoes text to the same channel
    ?/chat 'SOME_TEXT'
        - relays text to the all channels on this bridge
    ?/broadcast 'SOME_TEXT'
        - relays text to the all channels on all bridges as $BRIDGE_NICK
    ?/shutdown
        - kills the skype4pidgin2irc process

enjoy :)
