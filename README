skype4pidgin2irc install instructions for debian (ymmv)


/* install pidgin and the skype plugin */

    sudo apt-get install pidgin pidgin-skype


/* install the php bridge */

    pecl install dbus-beta

Add the extension=dbus.so line to your php.ini and restart Apache

    echo extension=dbus.so >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

Look at the phpinfo(); and be sure there is an entry for D-Bus


/* configure pidgin */

launch pidgin and create and activate an 'IRC' account
and set 'Username' and 'Server' under 'Login Options'
launch pidgin and create and activate a 'skype(D-Bus)' account
and set 'Username' under 'Login Options'
(you can also check 'Auto-start Skype' on the 'Advanced' tab)

you can test that pidgin is setup properly by running
the 'list-pidgin-accounts.php' via the terminal

    list-pidgin-accounts.php

once skype is running it will ask you to give pidgin API permission


/* configure skype4pidgin2irc */

open the file 'skype4pidgin2irc.php' in a text editor

    nano skype4pidgin2irc.php5

and add your nicks/aliases to the $ADMIN_NICKS array
then save and launch 'skype4pidgin2irc.php' via the terminal

    php skype4pidgin2irc.php

in pidgin open a chat session with each channel you want to brigde
you may need to get someone else to chat into the skype group
before it will appear in pidgin
(NOTE: the script now only handles one 2-way brigde but could easily be
made to accommodate multiple bridges and multiple channels each)
then in one of the channels type

    ?/setch1

then in the other channel type

    ?/setch2

for added coolness i suggest changing you IRC nick to 'SKYPE'

    /nick SKYPE

and in skype set 'Real Name' in your profile to 'IRC'


/* admin commands */

the following admin commands are currently supported:

    ?/setch1
        - sets one end of the bridge
    ?/setch2
        - sets the other end of the bridge
    ?/myip
        - returns the current puclic server IP
    ?/sleep
        - resets bridge channels to null
    ?/kill
        - kills the skype4pidgin2irc process
    ?/echo 'SOME_TEXT'
        - echoes text to the same channels
        (you can also ?/setch1 and ?/setch2 in the same channel for loopback)


enjoy :)
